Lisa,Murkowski,R,AK,Neutral,"All weekend long my staff and I have been monitoring implementation of President Trump's recent EO related to immigration - consulting wiht both the Dept. of Homeland Security and stakeholders in Alaska. Like others, we are trying to understand the remifications of this action, including the suspension of the refugee resettlement program and its impact on Alaskans and those coming to our community. We have spoken with Catholic Social Services of Alaska about the effect of the EO in our state. President Trump has made it clear that the security of Americans is his top priority. I agree. I also believe U.S. immigration policy must strike a balance between national security and our values as Americans and that how we implement policy matters.

John,McCain,R,AZ,Opposed,"Our government has a responsibility to defend our borders, but we must do so in a way that makes us safer and upholds all that is decent and exceptional about our nation. It is clear from the confusion at our airports across the nation that President Trump’s executive order was not properly vetted. We are particularly concerned by reports that this order went into effect with little to no consultation with the Departments of State, Defense, Justice, and Homeland Security. Such a hasty process risks harmful results. We should not stop green-card holders from returning to the country they call home. We should not stop those who have served as interpreters for our military and diplomats from seeking refuge in the country they risked their lives to help. And we should not turn our backs on those refugees who have been shown through extensive vetting to pose no demonstrable threat to our nation, and who have suffered unspeakable horrors, most of them women and children. Ultimately, we fear this executive order will become a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism. At this very moment, American troops are fighting side-by-side with our Iraqi partners to defeat ISIL. But this executive order bans Iraqi pilots from coming to military bases in Arizona to fight our common enemies. Our most important allies in the fight against ISIL are the vast majority of Muslims who reject its apocalyptic ideology of hatred. This executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country.

James,Inhofe,R,OK,Support,"Excerpt - President Trump's executive order follows through on the promises made on the campaign trail to secure our country and protect our citizens. This is not a Muslim ban, as the measure suspends all refugee admittance for 120 days and suspends the issuance of visas to nationals of seven countries for 90 days. Time and again terrorists have stated their intent to infiltrate refugee populations in order ot spread their ideology and terror throughout the West, as has already happened in Europe. Frthermore, the pause on visa applicants for countries that Condress and the Departments of State an dHomeland Security have determined as areas of concern to national security is reasonable given the unrest and the state of instability in each of those countries.

It is clear from the confusion at our airports across the nation that President Trump’s executive order was not properly vetted. We are particularly concerned by reports that this order went into effect with little to no consultation with the Departments of State, Defense, Justice, and Homeland Security. Such a hasty process risks harmful results. We should not stop green-card holders from returning to the country they call home. We should not stop those who have served as interpreters for our military and diplomats from seeking refuge in the country they risked their lives to help. And we should not turn our backs on those refugees who have been shown through extensive vetting to pose no demonstrable threat to our nation, and who have suffered unspeakable horrors, most of them women and children. Ultimately, we fear this executive order will become a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism. At this very moment, American troops are fighting side-by-side with our Iraqi partners to defeat ISIL. But this executive order bans Iraqi pilots from coming to military bases in Arizona to fight our common enemies. Our most important allies in the fight against ISIL are the vast majority of Muslims who reject its apocalyptic ideology of hatred. This executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country.
